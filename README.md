# Portfolio_Projects
The follwing repositry contains following projects described by folder:

1. Covid Analysis
* The data was taken from official records of ourworldindata.org
*	SQL query was written to select relevant data.
*	Tables were joined to analyse deaths due to covid and vaccinations.
*	After SQL queries, data was visualized in tableau. Dashboard was created in which deaths by continents were inspected, trend of deaths was analyzed in Pakistan, its neighbouring countries and developed countries for comparison. The trends were further forecasted for future predictions and a global world deaths map was created in tableau dashboard. The dashboard can be accessed at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/muhammad.omer.farooq3955/viz/CovidAnalysis_16626146923910/Dashboard1
* It demostrates use of: using SQL to select desired sub data from data for use, joining tables using tableau only, Creating calculated fields, creating maps and representing data around the globe, choosing correct repsentation to display data, calculating forecasts for future decisions

2. Hotel Revenue Analysis
*	The revenue trend was analysed of two hotels in the data set and business questions were answered. The visualizations were made using tableau dashboards. The data from different tables were joined in tableau and then visualizations were made.
*	New fields were created
*	Hierarchies were made to develop and represent tables in dashboard
*	Revenue trend by hotel was graphically represented
*	Important attributes were statistically determined that included revenue for total nights, discount average and its effect, role of car parking in revenue generation. 
*	It was needed to determine whether increasing car parking space would have an impact on revenue or not.
*	The dashboard is accessible at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/muhammad.omer.farooq3955/viz/Hotel_Revenue_analysis/Dashboard1
* It demonstates use of: asking right business questions from data, analyzing data to generate insights for business and increasing profits, representing data using tableau dashboards, creating hierarchies, determining trend lines of data

3. Nashville Housing Data cleaning
* Data cleaning was demonstrated in this project where Nashville Housing messy data was cleaned using SQL.
* Datetime format was adjusted to more practical and standard date-only format.
* NULL values in address was removed and populated with useful data. It involved use of self joins
* Data in address columns were presented in a more useful and readable form. It was categorized properly by adding new columns to contain city infromation seprately.
* Data was also rearranged by praise functions
* Nonstandard keywords were replaced with standard keywords throughout the table
* Duplicate rows and non-required columns were removed
* It demonstrates use of: SQL for data cleaning, use of self joins and CTE for simplifiying query, use of string selection and maipulation techniques and functions, implementation of DDL, and DML for cleaning data

4. Simulator
*	The project focused on the development of an off-the-shelf computer simulated lab model of a radar system in MATLAB environment to demonstrate the concepts of radar theory and its practical applications. 
*	A GUI in python was developed for users to interact while experimenting and instruction manuals were developed for step-by-step guidance.
* It demonstrates use of python for application development and integrating it with MATLAB using MATLAB engine API
