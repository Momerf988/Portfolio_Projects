Project description:

1. The project focused on the development of an off-the-shelf computer simulated lab model of a radar system in MATLAB environment to demonstrate the concepts of radar theory and its practical applications. 
2. A GUI in python was developed for users to interact while experimenting and instruction manuals were developed for step-by-step guidance.

How to execute:

A. Extract nrad folder

B. Copy A lab file
1. Copy a lab template
2. Add variables inside the template for  use in matlab script
3. Add labels and entries by duplicating the template in the draw_gui function
4. Add the created variables in the write_parameters function
5. link the matlab script in the simulate function

C. In ui.py
1. In ui.py, import the new file
2. Add a new tab by copying the template for tabex
3. Add a new lab by copying the template for labex
4. Modify the run_lab function and add the newly created lab as in the lab example
